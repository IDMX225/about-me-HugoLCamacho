            <h2>An excerpt from Dracula</h2>

            <div>

                <p>"My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are. Here am I, who shall be twenty
                    in September, and yet I never had a proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had
                    three. Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn't it awful! I feel sorry, really and truly sorry,
                    for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don't know what to do with myself. And
                    three proposals! But, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of the girls, or they would be getting all
                    sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day
                    at home they did not get six at least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged
                    and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can despise vanity. Well, I must
                    tell you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from every one, except, of course,
                    Jonathan. You will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell Arthur. A
                    woman ought to tell her husband everything--don't you think so, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like
                    women, certainly their wives, to be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not
                    always quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch. I told you
                    of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was
                    very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling himself as to all
                    sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat,
                    which men don't generally do when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept
                    playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to me, Mina, very
                    straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his
                    life would be with me to help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I
                    did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my
                    present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time; and when I shook my head
                    his hands trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one else.
                    He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but only to know,
                    because if a woman's heart was free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to
                    tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked
                    very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and
                    that if I ever wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can't help crying:
                    and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being proposed to is all very nice and all that
                    sort of thing, but it isn't at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know
                    loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to know that, no matter what he
                    may say at the moment, you are passing quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present,
                    I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.</p>
