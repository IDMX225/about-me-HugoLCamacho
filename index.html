            <h2>Hover effects</h2>

            <div>

                <p>
                    For my about me I decided to research hover effects that can be done using CSS and HTLM on images.
                    Hover effects can used to spice up one’s own website to add more flare to it and they can also be
                    used for practical purposes to improve the useability of a website. For me, however, I much strongly
                    prefer to use hover effects for the increased useability over flare. While most of my use of image
                    hover effects were made for practical uses, I did add a bit of flare to some parts.
                </p>

                <p> While not an image, I did use my first hover effect at the very top in the nav. I decided that the
                    nav bar hamburger and buttons should have a hover effect just so a user will know where they can
                    activate the buttons. My first introduction to hover effects were from the YouTube video from Kevin
                    Powell where he shows how to build a hamburger nav bar button (This video can be found in the READ
                    ME). In the video, he used a hover effect to change the color of text on the nav bar. I liked the
                    idea, so I used it for mine. He also added a hover effect that would underline the element being
                    which adds more feedback to the user. I didn’t sue that underline effect however because I wanted a
                    hamburger on both desktop and mobile versions of the site which was very different from his approach
                    where he took out the hamburger button and just left all the links on the header. I didn’t think
                    that would work to well on the hamburger menu, so I decided to not do it. Instead, I added a hover
                    effect to the button itself that changes background and border color. </p>

                <p> One bit of flare I did was on my avatar. By default, its set to black and white. If you were to
                    hover over it, it will transition into color and a different color background and boarder will come
                    up. I went with a picture frame look with the grooved boarder and I liked the look a lot, so I added
                    it to my next section. </p>

                <p> The gallery has been a big issue of mine for most of the semester. I couldn’t get it to look like
                    what I have in my mind, even now. One gripe I had was that I couldn’t get the photos to be as big as
                    I wanted them to be since it would either take up too much space or not scale how I wanted them.
                    With hover effects, I found a mild solution. I added a scale transformation that makes the images
                    bigger only when hovering over it. This makes it so that the photos can stay a smaller size and fit
                    and scale with the screens while also giving the option to the user to take a closer look at the
                    photos if they want. I also added my photo frame like boarder to the images when they scale as a bit
                    of flare but also just so the user knows it’s not an error. I learned the scale effect from a
                    website called Fooplugins that show cases many effects (This site can be found in the READ ME) </p>


                <p> While hover effects are nice and can be used to improve the sites usability there can be some down
                    sides. I think it’s important to note now that these are only features for the desktop version of
                    the site since mobile devices usually don’t have a cursor that can hover. For this project, I only
                    included the hover effects on the desktop version of the site. You can see the difference with the
                    avatar. On mobile, it has its true colors while on desktop its black and white. </p>
