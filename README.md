## The Header and Nav bar
The header was one of the frist things we worked on. It showed us how to import images to use on the site and
also showed us how html works with the different tags. Later on it was one of the first things we decorated with CSS.
I learned how to add a background color, color text, and boarders in this section. Towards the end, I added a nav bar that will appare with the click of a button and can take the user to different sections without needing to manuallu go to them 

## The bio and hobbies
This has some gernal information about me. We learned about add text and how they can be broken up using things like <p> . The hobbies section is where I learned to use lists.

## the video
On the site, there is a short video that I had to upload. This showed me how to embed a video from youtube onto the website.

## The Gallery
The gallery was the my biggest headache. We learned to add multiple photos and put them in a gallery. For me  however, I could never get my ideal version of a gallery. Everything was either too big and therfore cant fit where it needs or to small too the point that the quality of the image was bad. Either way, this section is where I learned how to use grid/flex. Later on, I would use the gallery imeges to add hover effects and get to play with them a bit.

## Hover effects
This is the newest section. It just goes over my thoughts when it comes to why I use hover effects. This section is uniqe in that its the only section left with the overflow scroll thing which I used a decent amount of untill I learned other methods of keeping elements in their place.
I decicded to keep the overflow scroll here just as a reminder that its a thing

## Contact
Thisd section is the craziest one. When I first did this section, I learned alot. But will all the things that needed to be done for this section to look good and work, my brain got overloaded and I forgot how it works the next morning. I can't really recall what I learned in this section.

## Footer
A good old classic footer. For a majority of the semester, it had the same css properties as the header so it was nothing to specical

## Color scheme
I picked my two favourit colors which are blue and pink then I tried to find other colors that contrast well with them. Pinked didn't really work however, so I went a little darker and endup with a redish pink color (code #f56c6b) and a light blue (code  #427bf5) as my starting colors. Some of the other colors where a much lighter and greener looking blue (code #2bf5af), an ugly brown (code #756d5a), and a nice orange/yellow (code #f5be42). I might have had one extra color but I dont think i ended up using it.
